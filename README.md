# Wuxia-Epub-Creator
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
A small python program which will create an Epub file from wuxiaworld.co  
make sure the url is wuxiaworld.co and not wuxiaworld.com

You need python 3.9
also install following modules in python

EbookLib ,
beautifulsoup4 ,
requests ,
tqdm ,
lxml.

replace url with the url of the epub you want and run it. 

contact: bieleft2020@gmail.com if you have an issue

I know its not official source and they steal stuff but
the reason I used wuxiaworld.co is so the website has almost every wuxia or xianxia novels. and Extraction is much easier than other. 

this is my first ever project
